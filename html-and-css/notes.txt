			CSS variables

These allow us to define something once and just refer it by just is variable name

How to insert a defined variable

	var(--name, alt_value)

	name -> required. Must start with two dashes.
	alt_value -> optional. it is the fall back value incase if variable is not found.


css variables can have a global or local scope

Global variables can be accessed any where in the document. There are usually declared under the " :root " selector

example of global variable

:root{
	--primary:#fffff;
	--secondary:#00000;
}
